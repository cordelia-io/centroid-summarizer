# Extractive text summarization using centroid distance

This package is derived from the original implementation by the authors of the paper "Centroid-based Text Summarization through Compositionality of Word Embeddings" accepted at MultiLing Workshop at EACL 2017. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1003

Original author: Gaetano Rossiello [gaetano.rossiello@ibm.com](mailto:gaetano.rossiello@ibm.com)

## Tutorial

The method is described in this step-by-step guide: [A Better Approach to Text Summarization](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-better-approach-to-text-summarization-d7139b571439)
